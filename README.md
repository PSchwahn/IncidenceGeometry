This project aims to formalize some aspects of synthetic incidence geometry in Lean, mostly affine and projective spaces.

The mathematical content is inspired by a lecture of Prof. Klaus Metsch (JLU Gie√üen) in the winter term 2017/18 and based on his unpublished lecture notes, which are themselves based on the book [_Foundations of Incidence Geometry, Projective and Polar Spaces_](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20972-7) by J. Ueberberg.

Currently included:
* basics on affine and projective planes
* the projective closure of an affine plane
* cardinality results on finite affine/projective planes
* Some additional axioms (Desargues/Pappus/...)
* a projective plane minus a line is an affine plane (WIP)

Currently excluded:
* Higher-dimensional geometries
* Vector spaces as affine spaces
* Projectivization of vector spaces
* Block designs
