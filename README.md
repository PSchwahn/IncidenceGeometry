This is a formalization of some aspects of synthetic incidence geometry in Lean, mostly affine and projective spaces.

The project is inspired by a lecture of Prof. Klaus Metsch (JLU Gie√üen) in the winter term 2017/18 and based on his unpublished lecture notes, which are themselves based on the book _Foundations of Incidence Geometry, Projective and Polar Spaces_ by J. Ueberberg.
